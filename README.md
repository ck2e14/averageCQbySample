How?

1. Download & Install Node (JavaScript runtime) https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Download this code repo, unzip it

3. In the code's directory, copy & paste the .xlsx input spreadsheet (name it 'input.xlsx' or change the 'input' variable in the code)

4. In the command line (in that directory) run `npm i` to install dependencies

5. Run command `node app-min.mjs`

6. App creates an output .csv named with today's date. It will overwrite a previously made output .csv if done on the same day.
